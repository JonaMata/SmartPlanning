# SmartPlanning

### QUESTIONS:
- What are permissions for the caretaker? Are they editable?

### TO DO:
- fix confirm password
- not register same user twice
- reorder main menu
- remove username -> e-mail is also unique id
- User can edit settings for caretakers. The caretaker is selected in a contact list
