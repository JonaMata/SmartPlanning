# SmartPlanning

### QUESTIONS:
- What are permissions for the caretaker? Are they editable?

### TO DO:
- not register same user twice
- reorder main menu
- User can edit settings for caretakers. The caretaker is selected in a contact list
- change layout according to design (make it usable with mobile version)
- caretakers must have a selection screen to choose which users planning
- add option for tabs for a user to choose (school, work, ...)
