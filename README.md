# SmartPlanning

### QUESTIONS:
- What are permissions for the caretaker? Are they editable?

### TO DO:
- not register same user twice
- reorder main menu
- User can edit settings for caretakers. The caretaker is selected in a contact list
- change layout according to design (make it usable with mobile version)
- caretakers must have a selection screen to choose which users planning
- add option for tabs for a user to choose (school, work, ...): When caretakers/user makes a new tab, activities can be added to the tabs
- add delete account button in settings
- Location based data to indicate travel time
- Auto-filling assignments (late, or trivial time) aka event handling to manage unfinished or new tasks without due date
